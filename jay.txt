NAME
       jay - an LALR(1) parser generator for Java and C#

SYNOPSIS
       jay  [ -tv ] [ -c ] [ -p ] [ -b file_prefix ] [ -V yyValue ] filename <
       skeleton

DESCRIPTION
       Jay reads the grammar specification in the file filename and  generates
       an  LR(1) parser for it.  The parsers consist of a set of LALR(1) pars-
       ing tables and a driver routine from the file skeleton written  in  the
       Java  programming language.  Jay writes the parse tables and the driver
       routine to standard output.

       The following options are available:

              -b file_prefix
                     The -b option changes the prefix prepended to the  output
                     file  names  to  the  string denoted by file_prefix.  The
                     default prefix is the character y.

              -c     The -c option makes jay generate C# code instead  of  the
                     default Java.

              -t     The  -t  option  arranges for debugging information to be
                     incorporated in the compiled code.

              -v     The -v option causes a human-readable description of  the
                     generated parser to be written to the file y.output.

              -p     The  -p option causes jay to print the directory in which
                     its sample skeleton files are installed.   If  a  project
                     wants to use the default skeleton file included with jay,
                     it can use this option in a makefile to find the path  to
                     the  skeleton  or  skeleton.cs file included with the jay
                     distribution.

       If the environment variable TMPDIR is set, the string denoted by TMPDIR
       will be used as the name of the directory where the temporary files are
       created.

FILES
       skeleton
       y.output
       /tmp/yacc.aXXXXXX
       /tmp/yacc.tXXXXXX
       /tmp/yacc.uXXXXXX

DIAGNOSTICS
       If there are rules that are never reduced, the number of such rules  is
       reported  on  standard  error.  If there are any LALR(1) conflicts, the
       number of conflicts is reported on standard error.

HISTORY
       Jay is derived from Berkeley yacc .  Input conventions  closely  follow
       those  of  yacc ; for details, consult the parser skeleton file and the
       commented example included with the sources.
